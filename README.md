## What is Fluint

This project was born out of the frustrations of the cumbersome, non-intuitive, level design process that modern 3D tools provide. our mission with this project is to build a utility that's aimed at making the level design process as efficient and mindless as possible, we want to provide powerful yet fluent tools for the designer.
